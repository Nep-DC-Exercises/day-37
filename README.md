# POST & Altering Database

## Date: 10/18/19 W8 D5 D37

### Summary

We continued working on our Apple CEO's app. Today we created a form element in the view component that upon submission, sent a POST request to the /ceos/add endpoint. When hitting that endpoint, that creates an instance of an apple executive and inserts the data from the form into the database. The model makes use of an asynchronous instance method to that makes use of sanitized inputs prior to inserting into the table that stores the executives' data.

<!-- The `apple_ceos` folder is in-class code-along work. The exercise assigned today was to refactor our previous front-end project using the async/await syntax.
